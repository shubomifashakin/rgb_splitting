# Splitting Functionality

## Context

Users want to upload an image & split it into different color channel combinations. They also want to be able to apply a grain effect to images.

# Flow

1. Users sends a post request to the **/break** endpoint with the channel & grain values.
2. Their request is validated & if valid, a presigned-post url is generated for them to upload their image directly to s3.
3. The user uploads their image to the presigned url with all the required fields.
4. Once the image is uploaded to s3, it triggers a lambda function **(splitting-handler)** which receives the details of the image uploaded.
5. The image & its metadata is fetched from s3 & then the image is processed using the channel & grain values the user specified.
6. Once the image is processed, all the processed images are uploaded to s3 & the result of the process is stored in dynamodb.
7. The user can then query the **/broken/{imageId}** endpoint with the image id to get the result of the process.

## Possible Channel Combinations

Below are the list of possible channel combinations users can send to the api:

- **r**,
- **g**,
- **b**,
- **rg**,
- **rb**,
- **gr**,
- **gb**,
- **br**,
- **bg**,
- **rgb**,
- **rbg**,
- **grb**,
- **gbr**,
- **brg**,
- **bgr**,

# Caveats

## Channels (Required)

Users can specify the channels as either a single string **(e.g., 'r')** or an array of strings **(e.g., ['r', 'g', 'b'])** when making API requests. If a single string is provided, it will be applied to all channels, resulting in three images **(i.e. 'rg' is the same as ['rg', 'rg', 'rg'])**. If an array is provided, each element will be used as-is, and the API will produce as many images as there are elements in the array (up to a maximum of three elements in the array, if more than three elements are provided, the extra elements will be ignored). Each string must represent a valid channel combination. Specifying channels is **required**.

## Grains (Optional)

Users can specify the grains as either a single number **(e.g., 0)** or an array of numbers **(e.g., [0, 255])** when making API requests. If a single number is provided, it will be applied to all channel images. If an array is provided, each element will be used as-is, and the API will produce as many images as there are elements in the array (up to a maximum of three elements in the array, if more than three elements are provided, the extra elements will be ignored). The max grain effect is capped at 255. Grains are **optional**.

## Grain & Channel Limitations

If a user specifies a grain and channel combination that would not alter the image in any way, the API will return a **400 error**. This is to prevent users from uploading an image and then receiving the same image back unchanged. Additionally, in cases where the user provides valid grain and channel combinations, the API will exclude any combination that would not result in a different image. For example, if the user specifies `["rg", "rgb", "bg"]` as the channels and `[100, 0, 255]` as the grains, the API will only return results for `["rg", 100]` and `["bg", 255]`, as the other combinations would not produce a different image.

**Examples:**
The following are examples of grain and channel combinations that would not alter the image in any way & would result in a **400 error**

- Channels: **"rgb"**, Grain:0
- Channels: **"brg"**, Grain:0
- Channels: **"grb"**, Grain:0
- Channels: **"rgb"**, Grain:[0]
- Channels: **"gbr"**, Grain:[0]
- Channels: **"rgb"**, Grain:[0, 0, 0]

The following would go ahead with the process but would only return results for the valid grain and channel combinations

- Channels: **["rg", "rgb", "bg"]**, Grain **[100, 0, 255]** -- This would only produce 2 Images **rg@100 & bg@255**
- Channels: **"rgb"**, Grain **[100, 0, 255]** -- This would only produce 2 Images **rgb@100 & rgb@255**

## Image Size Limitations

The maximum image size the user can upload depends on the plan they are on.

- Free Plan: **10MB**
- Pro Plan: **20MB**
- Executive Plan: **80MB**

## Rate Limitations

- Free Plan: **1/second & 200/month**
- Pro Plan: **5/second & 1000/month**
- Executive Plan: **5/second & 2500/month**
