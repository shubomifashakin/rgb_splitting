# Why DynamoDb?

## Problem

The main reason i didnt go for RDS with Postgres is that i would need to setup a VPC for it and then place the RDS instance in a private subnet. Although this is not an issue and is actually a good practice, it would add a lot of complexity to the project & increase the cost of the project. This project requires access to the internet because users need to make payments through the payment gateway api, reubscriptions also happen automatically. This would require me to setup a NAT gateway for the lambdas to have access to the internet & this is expensive. NAT Gateways cost $0.045/hour which translates to about $32 per month, which is a lot for a small project.

## Solution

I went for DynamoDb because it is a serverless database which can run without the need for a VPC.

## Pros

1. I would not need to setup a VPC for the database.
2. I would not need to setup a NAT gateway for the lambdas to have access to the internet.

## Cons

1. I would lose the relationships between all tables created.
2. I lose proper/flexible sorting of data stored in the database.
